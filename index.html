    <div class="mainmain"><p style="font-size:1.04vw;">Hi! My name is Celine Jugandi Pasutti and I am a 15 year old student in Grade 10 attending Queen Elizabeth Highschool in Edmonton, Alberta.
    Some of my interests are:</p>
    <ul style="font-size:0.862vw;">
      <li>➼ Gardening</li>
        <li>➼ Skiing</li>
          <li>➼ Video Games</li>
            <li>➼ Reading/Writing</li>
              <li>➼ Coding and Computer Science</li>
                <li>➼ Space and Astronomy/Astrology</li>
                  <li>➼ Makeup and Cosmetics</li>
                    <li>➼ Art and Music</li>
                      <li>➼ and anything with caffeine in it</li></ul>
<p>Overall, I get nervous very easily and to put it bluntly I constantly procrastinate- in fact, a running joke in my family is that I procrastinated being born.
  My mom's due date was December 26, 2005 and I was born January 9, 2006. This level of procrastination unfortunately cost me a year of schooling (but at least I can drive before everyone my grade, right?).
  Besides procrastination, though, I am pretty responsible with my schoolwork and personal interests. I don't really know how to describe my personality, but typically, my friends describe me as someone who is extremely sarcastic,
  and doesn't deal with nonsense. Even though I tend to come off a little rough at first, I will always stand up for others and what I believe in with no shame. I don't really care what my peers think of me - I used to get bullied all the time because I wore
  really weird clothes and acted a little differently than others. I don't really know what happened, but it just occoured to me one day that the opinions of others doesn't really matter and I should stop breaking my back just for the ideals of people I don't even know or like.
  Besides, I like really weird and that's all that really matters at the end of the end of the day. Socially, I'm kind of dense. I don't pick up on hints or body language very well and unless someone tells me I'm doing something wrong bluntly and straight to the point, I will probably not catch
  on until i'm taking a shower or laying in bed like two years later. I have really terrible memory too so I forget to do a lot of the stuff my parents ask me to. They always blame this on my phone, but I think this trait is normal for anyone, since most of the people I know are constantly thinking
  of a million things at once like I am.
